TODO: New design - remaining calories (ratio) at top of home screen, below it is calendar, then meals
TODO: Add new meal category to Meal and allow users to pick it (lunch, dinner, etc.)
TODO: Add a "water gauge" that monitors your water intake at top of home screen, near calories
TODO: Add insulting messages (eventually at the end)

TODO: Make the calories in the food item RecyclerView look better - maybe make it into a pie graph?

TODO: June 5th, only get today's meals. Then implement a calendar select to get meals from different dates.
